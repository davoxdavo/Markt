Overview

This project demonstrates a modern iOS architecture using SwiftUI + UIKit, built to showcase seamless interaction between the two frameworks. The codebase follows a scalable MVVM-like architecture with dependency injection handled via a shared context (environment object).

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack & Features
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ UIKit-based foundation, allowing clean integration with both SwiftUI views and other UI layers
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ MVVM-inspired structure with services injected into ViewModels
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Protocolized services for easy mocking and testability
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Fully native‚Äîno third-party libraries, even for image loading/caching
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Async/Await for clean and modern concurrency
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Core Data for local storage and persistence

üß™ Testing
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Services are protocolized to allow mocking and unit testing
‚Ä¢ ‚è≥ ViewModels are not yet protocolized due to time constraints but structured to allow easy refactoring
‚ôªÔ∏è Scalability & Cross-Platform Potential

The architecture is intentionally grounded in UIKit, making the project highly adaptable and scalable. 
The codebase can:
‚Ä¢ Scale well with modular SwiftUI or pure UIKit UIs
‚Ä¢ Be adapted to multi-platform environments like Flutter or React Native, by reusing service logic and data layers
‚Ä¢ Serve as a base for shared business logic across mobile platforms

This flexibility makes it ideal for teams transitioning between UI technologies or aiming for cross-platform strategies.

üìå TODO
‚Ä¢ Protocolize ViewModels for full testability
‚Ä¢ Add UI Tests with XCTest
‚Ä¢ Add accessibility support
